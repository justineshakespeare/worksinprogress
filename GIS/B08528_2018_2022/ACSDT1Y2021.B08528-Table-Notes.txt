Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.<br/><br/>

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html\">ACS Technical Documentation<\/a>). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br/><br/>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tables for Workplace Geography are only available for States; Counties; Places; County Subdivisions in selected states (CT, ME, MA, MI, MN, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT, WI); Combined Statistical Areas; Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and their associated Metropolitan Divisions and Principal Cities; Combined New England City and Town Areas; New England City and Town Areas, and their associated Divisions and Principal Cities. Tables B08601, B08602, B08603, and B08604 are also available for Place parts and County Subdivision parts for the 5-year ACS datasets.<br/><br/>

These tabulations are produced to provide estimates of workers at the location of their workplace. Estimates of counts of workers at the workplace may differ from those of other programs because of variations in definitions, coverage, methods of collection, reference periods, and estimation procedures. The ACS is a household survey which provides data that pertains to individuals, families, and households.<br/><br/>

Workers include members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work last week.<br/><br/>

In 2019, methodological changes were made to the class of worker question. These changes involved modifications to the question wording, the category wording, and the visual format of the categories on the questionnaire. The format for the class of worker categories are now listed under the headings \"Private Sector Employee,\" \"Government Employee,\" and \"Self-Employed or Other.\" Additionally, the category of Active Duty was added as one of the response categories under the \"Government Employee\" section for the mail questionnaire. For more detailed information about the 2019 changes, see the 2016 American Community Survey Content Test Report for Class of Worker located at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html\"> http://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html<\/a>.<br/><br/>

The 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the March 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineations due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br/><br/>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br/><br/>
